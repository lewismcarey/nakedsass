# nakedsass - an unopinionated SASS Framework (v2)

	/'neIkId/
	adjective
	1. (of a person or part of the body) without clothes
	2. (especially of feelings, behaviour or css) expressed openly; undisguised; without addition or embellishment.
	

## Our Mandate

* unopinionated
* manage the fundamemtals (normalisation, specificity, inheritance & the cascade) 
* be intuitive, useful and reusable
* include base styles layouts/patterns/components and tools

In order to meet these, we need to make this thing be two things - naked and easy.
